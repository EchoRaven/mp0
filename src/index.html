    <p>
      I am a first-year Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), 
      advised by Prof. Bo Li in the Secure Learning Lab. My research focuses on multimodal large language models, 
      AI safety, and AI agents. I am particularly interested in developing safe, efficient, and practical multimodal 
      agents that can effectively interact with and understand the world through multiple modalities.
